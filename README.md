# Project Overview

This project consists of visualizing through graphics how many bacteria the navel contains that can make it ideal for making synthetic meat.

The participants who took part in this research are anonymous, so they have been assigned an identification number so that they and the researchers can consult the results through this website.

# Summary

In this analysis we have used different tools such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS and a json file to gather all the information from our participants to be able to create our charts.

## Bar Chart 

This chart allow us to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) and also the ID number of the participants.

## Bubble Chart

The bubble chart allows us to display the same information as above but we have also added labels and this is just a better way to visualize data and compare.

# Gauge Chart

This graph allows us to see the frequency of weekly washing of the navel per participant.
